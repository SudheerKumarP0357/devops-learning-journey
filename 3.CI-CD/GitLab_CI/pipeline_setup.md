## GitLab CI Pipeline Setup

### Creating a Simple Pipeline
1. **Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` File**:
    - In the root of your project, create a file named `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
    - Add the following content:
    ```yaml
    stages:
      - build
      - test
      - deploy

    build:
      stage: build
      script:
        - echo "Building the project..."

    test:
      stage: test
      script:
        - echo "Running tests..."

    deploy:
      stage: deploy
      script:
        - echo "Deploying the project..."
    ```

2. **Commit and Push**:
    - Commit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to your repository.
    - Push the changes to GitLab.

3. **View Pipeline**:
    - Go to your GitLab project.
    - Click on `CI / CD` > `Pipelines` to view the pipeline status.
