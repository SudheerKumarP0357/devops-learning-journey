# Day 3: Essential Commands
## Tasks
1. **File Viewing Commands**:
   - Practice using `cat`, `more`, `less`, `head`, and `tail` to view file contents.
   - Use `tail -f` to monitor log files in `/var/log`.

2. **Search Operations**:
   - Use `grep` to search for specific words or patterns within files.
   - Combine `grep` with `pipe` (`|`) to filter output from commands like `ps aux | grep ssh`.

3. **File Searching**:
   - Use `find` to search for files based on name, type, or modification date.
   - Practice using `locate` for quick file searches after updating the database with `updatedb`.

## Outcome
Enhanced command-line efficiency through powerful file and text handling techniques.
