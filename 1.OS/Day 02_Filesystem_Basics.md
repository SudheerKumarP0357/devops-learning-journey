## Tasks
1. **Explore the Filesystem**:
   - Use `ls`, `cd`, `pwd` to navigate directories.
   - Explore the contents of `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, and `/usr`.

2. **File Operations**:
   - Create directories using `mkdir`, and practice nested directory creation with `mkdir -p`.
   - Copy and move files (`cp`, `mv`) between directories.

3. **View File Details**:
   - Use `ls -l` and `stat` to view file properties.
   - Understand the output of `ls -lh` for human-readable file sizes.

## Outcome
A deeper understanding of Linux directory structure and basic file management.
