# Day 5: Permissions and Ownership
## Tasks
1. **Permission Exploration**:
   - Check file permissions using `ls -l`.
   - Modify file permissions using `chmod` (symbolic and numeric modes).

2. **Ownership Commands**:
   - Use `chown` to change file ownership and `chgrp` for group changes.
   - Practice setting different ownerships for user-created directories.

3. **Permission Scenarios**:
   - Create files and directories with different permission levels (read-only, read-write).
   - Use `chmod 755`, `chmod 644`, and explore implications.

## Outcome
A comprehensive understanding of how to manage file permissions and ownership in Linux.
